This week's homework involved choosing small bits of the web and recreate them with css.  I enjoy css a lot more than ruby, so the homework has been bearable.  However, I'm frustrated with it because I'm doing way more of a duck tape approach to get it close than what may be what one would actually use in production.  So while I am learning more about properties, I feel like I'm not learning the right way to do things* and ergo developing poor design/ux habits before I even start.
