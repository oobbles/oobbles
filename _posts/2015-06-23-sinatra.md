The last few days have been devoted to taking our inventory management system and creating a ux that was not on the command line for it.  To do this we made use of [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/).

```ruby
get "/search\_parts_category" do
  erb :"search\_category_parts"
end

get "/search\_parts_choice/:number" do
  erb :"list\_chosen_parts"
end

get "/search\_parts\_zip_code" do
 erb :"search\_zip_parts"
end
 
get "/search\_zip\_parts_choice/:zip" do
   erb :"list\_chosen\_zip_parts"
end
```

Sinatra enables us to use views (the erb files that are served to the user) and controllers, which you see above.  The controllers are kind of like traffic cops- receiving request and routing them into the right path.
